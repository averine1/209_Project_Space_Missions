As the size of satellites grew, Ariane 1 quickly gave way to the more powerful Ariane 2 and Ariane 3 launchers, which were heavily based upon the original rocket.",

Drawing heavily upon the preceding Ariane 3, it was designed to provide a launcher capable of delivering heavier payloads and at a lower cost per kilogram than the earlier members of the Ariane family. The Ariane 4 was principally an evolution of the existing technologies used, as opposed to being revolutionary in its design ethos; this approach quickly gained the backing of most ESA members, who funded and participated in its development and operation. Capable of being equipped with a wide variety of strap-on boosters, the Ariane 4 gained a reputation for being an extremely versatile launcher.",

The upper stage was also used as an uncrewed orbital target vehicle for the Gemini crewed spacecraft to practice rendezvous and docking. However, the launch vehicle family was originally developed for the Air Force and most of its launches were classified DoD payloads. The Atlas-Agena was a two-and-a-half-stage rocket, with a stage-and-a-half Atlas missile as the first stage, and an RM-81 Agena second stage. Initially, Atlas D missiles, redesignated as the LV-3, were used as the first stage. These were later replaced by the standardized Atlas SLV-3, and its derivatives, the SLV-3A and B. The final Atlas-Agena launch used an Atlas E/F.",

The SLV-3 would use a standardized configuration based on the Atlas D missile for all launches with the exception of different widths for the top of the rocket depending on the upper stage being flown. The SLV-3 had thicker gauge tank walls to support the weight of upper stages as well as upgraded engines and removal of unneeded ICBM hardware such as retrorockets. Although the main engines had greater thrust, the verniers were detuned slightly in the interest of improved ISP (vacuum specific impulse).",

The Kosmos-3M uses UDMH fuel and AK27I oxidizer (red fuming nitric acid) to lift roughly 1,400 kg (3,100 lb) of payload into orbit. It differed from the earlier Kosmos-3 in its finer control of the second-stage burn, allowing operators to tune the thrust and even channel it through nozzles that helped orient the rocket for the launching of multiple satellites at one time. PO Polyot manufactured these launch vehicles in the Russian town of Omsk for decades. The launch vehicle was retired in 2010.",

The Cyclone-4M is derived from the Tsyklon-4, which started its life as an all-hypergolic three-stage-to-orbit expendable launch vehicle planned for launch from a proposed site at the Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center in Brazil. However, Brazil backed out of the partnership with Ukraine in 2015, citing concerns over the project budget, the ongoing financial situation in both countries, and the future of the commercial launch market. In March 2017, Canadian company Maritime Launch Services announced plans to begin launching a modified version, the Cyclone-4M, which features a Zenit-derived kerolox (LOX / RP-1) first stage in place of the originally planned R-36 ICBM-based first- and second-stage.",

The first stage was the RS-27 powered Extended Long Tank Thor, first flown on the 2000-series. Three or nine Castor-4 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off, replacing the less powerful Castor-2 boosters used on earlier models. Two second stages were available; the Delta-P, which had been flown on the Delta 1000 and 2000 series, or the Delta-K, an uprated version with the Aerojet engine. Some launches used a three-stage configuration in order to reach higher orbits. A Star-37D, Star-37E, or Star-48B PAM-D could be used as an upper stage. Launches with PAM-D upper stages were designated Delta 3XX0 PAM-D, rather than assigning a code to the upper stage for use in the four-digit sequence. From the 4000-series onwards, the PAM-D received the upper stage code \"5\", however this was not applied retrospectively to 3000-series rockets.",

After the Challenger disaster, President Ronald Reagan announced in December 1986 that the Space Shuttle would no longer launch commercial payloads, and NASA would seek to purchase launches on expendable vehicles for missions that did not require crew or Shuttle support. Many of these launches thus were moved to Delta II. The rocket also launched numerous payloads for the United States Air Force including many Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.",

Perhaps the most significant change was the switch from kerosene to liquid hydrogen fuel, with new tankage and a new engine required. The Delta IV Medium (Delta 9040) was the most basic Delta IV. It featured a single CBC and a modified Delta III second stage, with 4-meter liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks (called a Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS)) and a 4-meter payload fairing. The Delta IV Medium+ (4,2) (Delta 9240) had the same CBC and DCSS as the Medium, but with the addition of two 1.5-m (60-in) diameter solid rocket booster Graphite-Epoxy Motors (GEM-60s) strap-on boosters. The Delta IV Medium+ (5,2) (Delta 9250) was similar to the Medium+ (4,2), but had a 5-m\u2013diameter DCSS and payload fairing for larger payloads. The Delta IV Medium+ (5,4) (Delta 9450) was similar to the Medium+ (5,2), but used four GEM-60s instead of two.",

As a project, it was derived from the military program Pierres pr\u00e9cieuses (fr.: gemstones) that included the five prototypes Agate, Topaze, Emeraude, Rubis, and Saphir (Agate, Topaz, Emerald, Ruby, and Sapphire), and drew heavily upon the knowledge and technologies that had been previously developed.",

The Dnepr control system was developed and produced by the JSC \"Khartron\", Kharkov. The Dnepr was a three-stage rocket using storable hypergolic liquid propellants. The launch vehicles used for satellite launches have been withdrawn from ballistic missile service with the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces and stored for commercial use. A group of a total of 150 ICBMs were allowed under certain geopolitical disarmament protocols to be converted for use.",

Control system main developer enterprise was the Khartron NPO \"Electropribor\". The Energia used four strap-on boosters each powered by a four-chamber RD-170 engine burning kerosene/LOX, and a central core stage with four single-chamber RD-0120 (11D122) engines fueled by liquid hydrogen/LOX. The launch vehicle had two functionally different operational variants: Energia-Polyus, the initial test configuration, in which the Polyus system was used as a final stage to put the payload into orbit, and Energia-Buran, in which the Buran-class orbiters were the payload and the source of the orbit insertion impulse. Production of Energia rockets ended with the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Buran shuttle project.",

The Blue Streak missile predated the Europa program, having originally been developed by Britain primarily for military purposes, however, it was canceled in 1960.

Unlike most rockets in service, which are expendable launch systems, Falcon 9 is partially reusable. The first stage is capable of re-entering the atmosphere and landing vertically after separating from the second stage. First-stage landings can occur either back at the launch site or downrange on droneships. In addition to the first stage, Falcon 9's payload fairing is also reusable. The payload fairing halves utilize a parafoil to steer themselves toward a recovery vessel.",

On some launches to low Earth orbit, the fourth stage was not flown. Development of the Juno II was extremely fast due to being completely built from existing hardware. The main differences between the Juno II and Jupiter were stretched propellant tanks for increased burn time (the first stage burn time was approximately 20 seconds longer than on the Jupiter), a reinforced structure to support the added weight of upper stages, and the inertial guidance system replaced with a radio ground guidance package, which which was moved to the upper stages.",

It was the brainchild of Vladimir Chelomei's design bureau as a foil to Sergei Korolev's N1 rocket, whose purpose was to send a two-man Zond spacecraft around the Moon; Korolev openly opposed Proton and Chelomei's other designs for their use of toxic propellants. The unusual appearance of the first stage results from the need to transport components by rail. The central oxidizer tank is the maximum width for the loading gauge of the track. The six tanks surrounding it carry fuel and serve as the attachment points for the engines. Despite resembling strap-on boosters, they are not designed to separate from the central oxidizer tank.",

It was intended to launch the crewed TKS spacecraft and succeeded in launching four uncrewed test flights prior to the program's cancellation.",

In a typical mission, a Proton-M is accompanied by a Briz-M upper stage. The Proton-M launches the orbital unit (that is: the payload, the payload adapter, and the Briz-M) into a slightly suborbital trajectory. The first and second stages and the payload fairing crash into designated crash sites; the third stage crashes into the ocean. After the third stage separates, the orbital unit coasts for a brief period, then Briz-M performs its first firing to achieve orbital injection.",

Such a missile provided some advantages over a conventional ICBM. The structure and design of the fractional orbit bombardment system were similar to a conventional R-36 ICBM system. The main difference from a conventional ICBM was in the design of the re-entry vehicle, which is fitted with a single 2.4 Mt warhead, a de-orbit engine, and a control block. The control system independently uses inertial guidance and a radar altimeter which measure orbit parameters twice, once at the beginning of the orbital trajectory and again just before the firing of engines for de-orbiting. The silo launcher and command point were hardened against a nuclear blast.",

It was based on the UR-100N (SS-19 Stiletto) intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), supplied and operated by Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center. The liquid-fueled rocket comprised three stages. The lower two were based on the Soviet UR-100N ICBM; the first stage used an RD-0244 engine, while the second stage used an RD-0235. The third stage was a Briz-KM (Russian: \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0437-\u041a\u041c meaning Breeze-KM), which has a mass of about 6 tonnes when fuelled and is capable of flying for 7 hours and reigniting its engine six times during the flight, allowing different satellites to be placed into different orbits.",

It was originally built to launch a crewed Soyuz 7K-VI spacecraft for the Soviet armed forces. Following the cancellation of this program, the development of the rocket continued for the Soyuz 7K-S spacecraft. After this too was canceled, Soyuz-M development was also abandoned, and the rockets that had been completed were used to launch reconnaissance satellites.",

Titan II was originally designed and used as an ICBM, but was later adapted as a medium-lift space launch vehicle to carry payloads to Earth orbit for the United States Air Force (USAF), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Those payloads included the USAF Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), NOAA weather satellites, and NASA's Gemini crewed space capsules. The modified Titan II SLVs (Space Launch Vehicles) were launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, up until 2003.",

Vulcan is ULA's first launch vehicle design; it adapts and evolves technologies that were developed for the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets of the USAF's EELV program. The first-stage propellant tanks have the diameter of the Delta IV Common Booster Core but contain liquid methane and oxygen propellant rather than the Delta IV's liquid hydrogen and oxygen. The versions of the Vulcan rocket range from 0 to 6 side boosters on the first stage and standard or long fairing configuration, according to customer needs. You may see a configuration \"Vulcan Centaur\" listed below, this is a placeholder configuration we use for unknown missions.",

In February 2015, following a year of strained relations as a result of a Russian military intervention into Ukraine, Russia announced that it would discontinue its \"joint program with Ukraine to launch Dnepr rockets and [was] no longer interested in buying Ukrainian Zenit boosters, deepening problems for [Ukraine's] space program and its struggling Yuzhmash factory.\"",
