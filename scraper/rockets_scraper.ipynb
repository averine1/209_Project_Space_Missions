Both the first and second stages are powered by Merlin engines, using cryogenic liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as propellants. Unlike most rockets in service, which are expendable launch systems, Falcon 9 is partially reusable. The first stage is capable of re-entering the atmosphere and landing vertically after separating from the second stage. First-stage landings can occur either back at the launch site or downrange on droneships. In addition to the first stage, Falcon 9's payload fairing is also reusable. The payload fairing halves utilize a parafoil to steer themselves toward a recovery vessel.\",\n",
