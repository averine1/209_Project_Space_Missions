The observatory has two operational modes: Space-Earth interferometer and the single-dish. The first mode will provide high angular resolution up to 10-8 – 10-9 arcseconds to study the structure of the most compact objects in the Universe – supermassive black holes. The second mode  will have the best sensitivity to study the weakest sources of the Universe.",1,,
